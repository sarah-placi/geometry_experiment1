26	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	90_30_120_0	25	Based on the animation, you can clearly see that vaccinated mice survive much more than unvaccinated one.

47	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	90_30_120_0	30	The vaccinated group death rate changes, isn't fluid. Makes me think the vaccine slows it down but doesn't stop the virus, and body immunity helps get over the hump. This is all speculation. I actually would assume less mice would survive if the trial was redone, but for the sake of what I see on the screen, 30% survival rate.	DeltaP	1	27	2	None	1294

26	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	60	This strain seems to affect the 40% of all mice, more or less, so that would leave us with 60 survivors	DeltaP	1	19	1	-99	857
28	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	50	Based on the experiment, the effectiveness of the vaccine has managed to save roughly half of the total mice, which would lead to the same result if another 100 mice were to be added.	DeltaP	1	32	2	-99	1534

47	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	60	Only 60 vaccinated mice survived while all 100 unvaccinated died. It would be very hard to replicate having exactly 60 mice survive in another trial, I would expect this number to fluctuate up or down.	DeltaP	1	27	2	None	1294
53	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	50	In the vaccinated group, it seems about half of the mice lived and half of the mice died, while in the control group it seems that all of the mice died. It is possible this is an outlier case, but since I don't have any additional information to go off of, I'm using the results of this experiment as a prediction.	DeltaP	1	19	2	-99	620
58	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	50	It looks like its half and half really as half of the mice vaccinated died and half didnt, but i still think most would survive if they had the vaccination	DeltaP	1	44	2	NA	1011

65	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	60	The test showed that there is about a 40% chance of dying from the disease even if you had been vaccinated. However, without the vaccine, death occurs 100% of the time.	DeltaP	1	57	2	There were no issues.	1113
70	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	60	The results from the experiment show that the mice that just over half of the mice that were vaccinated lived after being exposed to the strain of bacteria.

91	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	50	Looking at the diagram on the left, it appears to me that about half the vaccinated mice died, whereas all of the unvaccinated died. On this basis I came to the conclusion that the vaccine was about 50% effective.	DeltaP	1	26	1	-99	486
93	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	60_60_120_0	60	I guess because around that number of mice surviced in the first trial when vaccinated. There will probably be some variation, though I can't tell for sure how much.	DeltaP	1	40	1	-99	585

26	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	30_90_120_0	70	Analyzing the results of the animation, you can clearly see that around 65-75 (my guess) are alive, so i think that around 70 mice would survive based on this data	DeltaP	1	19	1	-99	857
28	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	30_90_120_0	30	The effectiveness of this particular vaccine seems to have only saved the lives of about 30% of the total. This should possibly give around the same percentage effectiveness to another 100 mice.	DeltaP	1	32	2	-99	1534

47	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	30_90_120_0	70	70 mice survived while 100 unvaccinated mice died. Shows the vaccine is somewhat effective but it's unclear why those 30 mice still died.

53	test query: preventive strength	Necessary preventer	30_90_120_0	66	According to the results of this experiment about 1/3 of the vaccinated mice died in the vaccinated group for every 100 mice that dies in the unvaccinated group.
